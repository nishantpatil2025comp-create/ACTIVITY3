ACTIVITY 5




RESEARCH : A  phone number directory is essentially a database that contains contact information, including phone numbers, names, and sometimes addresses, for individuals and businesses.
Think of it as a modern-day version of the old-school phone book, but with more advanced search capabilities and often more detailed information.
These directories are used by sales teams, marketers, and even individuals who need to find contact details quickly. They can be accessed online, and some are free while others require a subscription or payment. The key difference between free and paid directories usually comes down to the depth of information, accuracy, and additional features like reverse phone lookup or business-specific data.

Find Accurate Contact Information: Instead of guessing or relying on outdated lists, you can use directories to get the most current phone numbers.
Save Time: Searching for contacts manually can take hours. Directories streamline the process, letting you focus on selling.
Expand Your Reach: With access to millions of records, you can find new leads and opportunities you might not have discovered otherwise.
Verify Information: Some directories offer reverse lookup features, so you can confirm who a number belongs to before making the call.

ANALYSE :
 Registration + Billing System for PG Rooms
User can register as a new member.


The program shows room options with prices.


Takes user input for:


Room type (1–4)


Food included or not (YES=1 / NO=0)


Calculates:


Total price


GST (18%)


Final bill amount


B. Customer Database Search
Program stores 5 customer IDs.


If ID matches predefined values, it prints:


Room number


Name


Food status


Total monthly bill


If no match → prints “No match found”







IDEATE:
Creating a program on the bill of customer after taking input of customer ID of 10 digit
number . After taking the input  from user ,the program should execute that the all information of customer like 



  Also,  at the end when customer ID is not found there should be a message of ‘invalid customer id’ or ‘not found’.
